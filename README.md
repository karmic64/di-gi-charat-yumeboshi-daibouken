# Di Gi Charat: Yumeboshi Daibouken

This is the source code for the Super Mario Bros. 2 hack "Di Gi Charat: Yumeboshi Daibouken", mainly produced by 125scratch.

Most of the graphical changes were done by 125scratch separately from me, so what you'll get by building this isn't really a "complete" version. For the full version visit the [ROMhacking.net page](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6394/).

## Build requirements

* `make`
* C compiler (preferably `gcc`)
* [64tass](https://tass64.sourceforge.net/)
* The original ROM in the main directory, named `Super Mario Bros. 2 (U) (PRG0) [!].nes` (CRC32 `7D3F6F3D`)
